# Pragmatic Drag and Drop in Svelte

This is a port of the [Pragmatic Drag and Drop](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/pragmatic-drag-and-drop) from [Atlassian's UI Kit](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/)'s [simple example](https://github.com/atlassian/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/discussions/71) to Svelte 5 with some modifications to make the code more easily reusable.

## Development Server

To start a local development version of the application, run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Assuming you've already run `pnpm install` to download the dependencies.
